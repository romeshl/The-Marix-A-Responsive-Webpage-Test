## Intro
I was supposed to create a responsive web page as the Mission - 0 of the ADVANCED FULL STACK DEVELOPER (CLOUD AND AI) course at Mission Ready HQ. 

While looking for some tutorials I came across this tutorial (linked below) which shows how to create a responsive web page using React and Tailwind CSS. 

[React JS & Tailwind CSS Responsive Website - Beginner Friendly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU-drSVodBw)

Since I've been wanting to give a Tailwind CSS a go. I decided to follow the tutorial. 

I wanted try and implement few things I've seen in some tutorials I've watched. 

My main objectives I wanted to achieve in this project was,

1. Create a responsive web page
2. Use and explore Tailwind CSS
3. Use a video as a background for a section on the web page (as seen in one of the tutorials I've checked.)
4. Use [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) 
5. Use and explore [React-typed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typed) package

I decided the make the web page after the 'The Matrix (1999)' movie just for fun.

I absolutely loved the Tailwind CSS. I think I'll be using this as my default CSS method unless I have to use another CSS method. 

It was quite easy, actually much easier for me to implement the responsiveness with Tailwind CSS. 

All the clickable elements displays a message as to display that they do work. 

Figuring out Tailwind CSS classes for CSS properties I wanted to use was challenging at times. But it was much easier after I found the [TailWind CSS Cheat Sheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/).

I also found way to sneak in regular CSS properties in TailWind CSS while looking for tutorial on [How to add text shadow in TailWind CSS](https://www.hyperui.dev/blog/text-shadow-with-tailwindcss).

I was pretty proud that I was able to style the scrollbar in the Gallery section by following and playing with the syntax in above tutorial.
